**Allen Pandey**  
*Computer Science Student | Software Engineering Aspirant*

I'm a Computer Science student at The University of Texas at Arlington (UTA), driven by a deep curiosity for technology and a passion for building solutions that make a difference. My journey began in Gorkha, Nepal—a historic district known for its rich cultural heritage—where I spent my early years before moving to Kathmandu for nearly a decade. There, I attended Siddhartha Banasthali Institute, one of Nepal's premier educational institutions, before pursuing a Business and Computer Science dual major at National College of Computer Studies (NCCS). This foundation ignited my interest in technology and problem-solving.

In January 2022, I moved to the United States to continue my education, starting with Business Administration at the University of Nebraska at Kearney before transferring to Dallas College to complete coursework toward an Associate in Science. This transition wasn't just geographical—it pushed me to adapt quickly, develop resilience, and embrace new perspectives. These experiences have shaped me into someone who thrives in diverse environments and approaches challenges with both analytical rigor and creative thinking. Now, as I pursue my Bachelor's in Computer Science at UTA, I'm focused on mastering the technical skills needed to excel in software engineering while maintaining that global perspective that helps me see problems from multiple angles.

My goal is to join a forward-thinking tech team where I can contribute to building products that solve real-world problems and improve people's lives. I'm particularly drawn to roles that combine technical excellence with innovation, where I can collaborate with talented teams, learn from industry leaders, and grow as both an engineer and a problem-solver. Whether it's developing scalable applications, architecting efficient systems, or exploring emerging technologies, I'm excited about the opportunity to make a meaningful impact in the tech industry.
